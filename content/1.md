# Introduction to Vue.js

Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces. It is designed to be incrementally adoptable, meaning you can use it as a library to enhance parts of your application or as a full-fledged framework for building complex single-page applications (SPAs).

## Key Features of Vue.js

1. **Reactive Data Binding**: Vue provides a simple and powerful way to bind data to the DOM using its reactivity system.
2. **Component-Based Architecture**: Applications are built using reusable and composable components.
3. **Directives**: Vue offers special attributes like `v-bind`, `v-for`, and `v-if` to manipulate the DOM efficiently.
4. **Vue Router**: For building SPAs, Vue Router allows seamless navigation between views.
5. **Vuex**: A state management library for managing shared state across components.
